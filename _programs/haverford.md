## Program Title: 
:squirrel: Haverford College Libraries Summer Internships

## Year Program Created: 
2011

## Short Description:
Over the past 6+ years, we have built a growing portfolio of faculty research projects, course support, and in-house digital collections projects in collaboration with our Quaker and Special Collections department. Six librarians now support digital scholarship on campus in some way, including a full-time DS Librarian and a postdoctoral fellow. Our roles in fostering DS have always been rather fluid, as we prefer to partner with faculty, students, and IT staff on collaborative projects. As a result, we are sometimes technical support, sometimes project managers, sometimes server admins, sometimes a web development team, sometimes pedagogical design/support, etc. as well as intellectual partners on research projects. We also are radically inclusive of undergraduate students in our work, which creates a range of challenges and rewards (and has a direct effect on the direction and pace of our project work). Students work as part of the DS team during the academic year as developers, as interns during the summer, and in our co-curricular fellowship program. 

In the past, our summer internships program has included two categories of students: interns working directly for the library on projects co-directed by DS and Quaker & Special Collections and faculty research assistants who are engaged in digital work. Our involvement with the latter group can fall anywhere on a spectrum between full-time management of the research assistant in tandem with the faculty member or the occasional checkin on faculty-directed work. This summer we have added a third category, library-coordinated self-designed summer research internships funded by the Center for Peace and Global Citizenship.
