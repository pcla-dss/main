# Program Title: 
Digital Learning Assistant Program

## Year Program Created:
2015

## Short Description:
Students play a critical role in designing and supporting Digital Learning at Muhlenberg College.  Collaborative opportunities to engage digital tools and technologies would not be possible without dedicated students equally invested in exploring the liberal arts, digitally. The Digital Learning Assistant (DLA) program is a peer learning model dedicated to providing resources and guidance as students engage new technologies and digital platforms to advance their learning. Digital Learning Assistants offer advanced knowledge of the digital tools that faculty most use in their courses and scholarship, including: 
- Mediamaking and Digital Storytelling
- ePortfolios/Domains/Web Publishing
- Mapping and GIS
- Digital Archives and Information Visualization

Digital Learning Assistants are available to work closely with students to offer guidance on  digital learning projects or assignments.   Students are always welcome to stop in to the HIVE, Ettinger Suite 002, to meet with a DLA at any of the available times listed on the drop-in schedule.
