Within this site, you will find a collection of descriptions and materials about Digital Scholarship and Digital Humanities programs facilitated within Library, IT, and merged Library/IT organizations. While each local instantiation is unique, we believe that our programs benefit from formal opportunities to share best practices and receive feedback on our programmatic activities. A grant awarded in 2018 by the Pennsylvania Consortium for the Liberal Arts (PCLA) enabled a series of in-person meetings and an undergraduate symposium where program organizers and students, respectively, were able to share their work. This site documents those efforts. 

## Share Your Work

Instructions for how to share information about your program and materials through this repository are forthcoming.
