## Project Description:

Sustainable Digital Scholarship Summer Programs through Consortial Collaboration

## Project Sponsor:
The Pennsylvania Consortium for the Liberal Arts (PCLA), made possible by an extension of generous funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation

## Project Abstract:

Digital scholarship and digital humanities summer programs are emerging inside of and with the support of library and IT organizations throughout the PCLA. While each local instantiation is unique, programs and program organizers would greatly benefit from formal opportunities to share best practices and receive feedback on programmatic activities. Further, undergraduate students would greatly benefit from more opportunities to share their evolving digital scholarship and digital humanities research. Combining these two related needs, we propose a series of three in-person, one-day meetings to support and sustain emerging collaborations among PCLA institutions fostering digital scholarship and digital humanities summer programs.
