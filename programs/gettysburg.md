Musselman Libraryâ€™s Digital Scholarship Summer Fellowship is a paid, 8-week, library-led initiative open to rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors from any major or discipline.

Fellows participate in a Digital Humanities community of practice and share their learning experiences throughout  the duration of the fellowship.
